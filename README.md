# Leamon-Leaf-Disease-Detection-Project

This project focuses on the detection and classification of diseases affecting lemon plant leaves using image processing and machine learning techniques. Lemon plants are vulnerable to various leaf diseases such as citrus canker, sooty mold, and leaf blight, which can significantly impact crop yield and quality. Early identification of these diseases is crucial for timely intervention and effective crop management.

A machine learning model—such as a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)—is trained on the labeled dataset to classify the leaf images into different disease categories or as healthy. The trained model is then evaluated on a separate test set to assess its accuracy, precision, recall, and overall performance.


Objectives:

1)To collect and preprocess a dataset of lemon leaf images.

2)To extract meaningful features for disease detection.

3)To develop and train a machine learning model for accurate classification.

4)To build a user-friendly system or interface for real-time disease diagnosis.

Technologies Used:

1)Python

2)OpenCV for image processing

3)TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch for deep learning

Expected Outcome: A robust, automated system that can accurately detect and classify common lemon leaf diseases, aiding farmers and agricultural experts in early diagnosis and improving crop health management.
